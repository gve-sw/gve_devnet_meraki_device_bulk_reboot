# GVE DevNet Meraki Device Bulk Reboot
An app that can reboot all the selected Access Points in a Meraki network in case there are issues arising with these devices. 

In a large network, you might have a lot of Access Points. Sometimes, an Access Point might not work correctly, but it's unclear which one exactly is causing the problem. Normally, every Access Point would need to be manually rebooted. 

This simple user interface makes it much faster and easier to reboot all Access Points and fix the problem.

## How to obtain a Meraki API Key

In order to use the Cisco Meraki API, you have to enable the API for your organization first. After having enabled API access, you can generate an API key. You can follow the following instructions on how to enable API access and how to generate an API key:

1. Log in to the Cisco Meraki dashboard

2. In the left-hand menu, go to `Organization > Settings > Dasbhoard API access`

3. Click on `Enable access to the Cisco Meraki Dashboard API`

4. Go to `Profile > API access`

5. Under `API access`, click on `Generate API key`

6. Save the API key in a safe place. Please note that the API key will be shown only once for security purposes. In case you lose the key, then you have to revoke the key and regenerate a new key. Moreover, there is a limit of only two API keys per profile.

> Note: Make sure this API key has write access to both the source and target organization. You can add your account as Full Organization Admin to both organizations by following the instructions [here](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions).
